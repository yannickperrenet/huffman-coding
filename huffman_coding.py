"""Huffman encoding and decoding.

`encode()` encodes a given stream fully such that `decode()` can decode
it (without needing the original text, because the frequency table is
stored in the encoding as well). The encoding format is as follows:

    - 1 byte: the number of (ASCII) characters in the frequency table.
    - X bytes: where X=5*value_of_previous_byte. These bytes store the
      frequency table using the schema given by
      `FREQ_TABLE_ENCODING_SCHEMA`.
    - Y bytes: the remaining bytes containing the encoded text.

To make sure the encoding of the text is "byte-aligned" we make use of a
`PSEUDO_EOF`. Once the `PSEUDO_EOF` is read during decoding, we stop
decoding further. Decoding is done using a Finite State Machine (FSM)
with a configurable `DECODER_WORD_SIZE` that determines the number of
transitions per state (`num_transitions = 1 << DECODER_WORD_SIZE`). This
makes decoding considerably faster as we no longer have to decode
bit-by-bit but can instead (at once) decode `DECODER_WORD_SIZE` number
of bits.

Todo:
    - Working with larger than memory input text.
    - The `DECODER_WORD_SIZE` can not be larger than 8 currently,
      because we decode byte-by-byte. To allow for larger values of
      `DECODER_WORD_SIZE` we would have to dynamically change the number
      of bytes that are read for decoding.
    - If `PSEUDO_EOF` is actually in the given text (to be encoded),
      then an error is raised. Although unlikely that the `PSEUDO_EOF`
      is in the text (currently a static uncommon character is chosen),
      if it is, then we error out. Alternatively, a new `PSEUDO_EOF` can
      be chosen (dynamically) that is not in the text. Only if all 256
      ASCII characters are in the text, then we error out.

        A possible performance improvement (at the cost of memory) would

        A single list containing all transitions for all states defining

        Each state will be a sequence of (1 << word_size) number of

    * Streams are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer
