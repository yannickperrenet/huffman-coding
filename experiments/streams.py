Possible inputs
- path to a file

Only allows "path to a file" as input because most streams aren't
seekable (which is required since `encode()` needs two passes). Thus the
solution to work with those is to write to a file and then read from
that file again.

>>> sys.stdin.seekable()
False

Text I/O is needed for input because that will contain "regular" text.


From Python docs ([source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#id2)):

    By reading and writing only large chunks of data even when the user
    asks for a single byte, buffered I/O hides any inefficiency in
    calling and executing the operating systemâ€™s unbuffered I/O
    routines. The gain depends on the OS and the kind of I/O which is
    performed. For example, on some modern OSes such as Linux,
    unbuffered disk I/O can be as fast as buffered I/O. The bottom line,
    however, is that buffered I/O offers predictable performance
    regardless of the platform and the backing device. Therefore, it is
    almost always preferable to use buffered I/O rather than unbuffered
    I/O for binary data.


./huffman_coding encode [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_STREAM]
- if [OUTPUT STREAM] is not given, then defaults to sys.stdout

./huffman_coding decode [INPUT STREAM] [OUTPUT_STREAM]
- Stream doesn't need to be seekable since decode needs 1 pass
